# school_py 

## What can I use it for?

Anything really, just use it as you want to. I doubt this is ever gonna become useful enough so that anybody except me would use it tho

## Why do you have this on github?

Because iServ's system that my school uses doesn't work properly

## Are you going to keep this up to date?

What the actual hell do you mean by that dude? 😂
I am one of the most infrequent code enjoyers, so don't expect anything close to consistent weekly updates.

## Are you mocking yourself?

Yes, often.
